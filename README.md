# job-thing

Node.js app. User auth, and basic website with signup, and making friends.

The idea was to model a contact-network, and share referral fees from jobs through the network when a contact gets succesfully employed.

Users and normal stuff are stored in MySQL. Check out `setupdb.sql` and make sure that you have a MySQL Server running with those databases/tables.
